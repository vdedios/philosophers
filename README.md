# Philosophers

A classic thread management problem.
## The problem

K philosophers seated around a circular table. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. If each philosopher does not eat in a specefic time he may die. The goal of this problem is to correctly manage all resources so no philosopher dies.

## Project specifications

Simple usage:

```bash
    ./philo_* <n_philos> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [<n_rounds>]
```

There are three different variations from the original problem:

**Philo_one** 

- There is one chopstick between each philosopher.
- Each philosopher is coded as a single `thread` and `mutexes` should be used to managed shared resources.
  
**Philo_two** 

- All chopsticks are now in the center of the table.
- Each philosopher is still coded as a single `thread` and `semaphores` should be used to manage shared resources.

**Philo_three** 

- All chopsticks are still in the center of the table.
- Each philosopher is now coded as a single `process` and `semaphores` are still used to manage shared resources.
